The Skyfield To-Do List
-----------------------

* Make all objects that are `.observe()`â€™d from Earth include a
  sublatitude and sublongitude coordinate stating the position on Earth
  from which they appear directly overhead.  When complete, make a note
  at the PyEphem GitHub issue:

  https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/issues/16

* When Earth Satellites are implemented, include the orbit number of a
  satellite's current position in the public attributes that are set on
  the resulting position object, as promised in PyEphem GitHub issue:
